# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper handling of null values and provides a solution.

## The Problem

Many JavaScript functions fail to gracefully handle `null` or `undefined` inputs. This can lead to unexpected behavior, runtime errors, or crashes.

## The Solution

Always explicitly check for null values before performing operations on them. Returning `null`, throwing an error, or using default values are effective ways to handle null inputs.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to see the buggy and corrected code.
